![David James Dimalanta Profile Picture](/0503.jpeg)

Hey! my name is David James, and I am a 1st year student at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, studying Human-Centered Design. What sets me apart is my dedication to understanding and addressing user needs, a skill sharpened through my studies and hands-on project experiences. I bring a unique blend of creative design thinking and technical proficiency to the table.\

I began my coding journey at the start of 2023 as a New Years resolution to learn a new skill. Today, I am fortunate to be able to work with a [student-led non-profit](https://globalspark.world/), and at a [home health & hospice solutions provider](https://empirehsi.com/). Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid reader and enjoy exploring the outdoors, which helps me stay creative and inspired.\

-   Javascript (ES6+)

-   Next.js
