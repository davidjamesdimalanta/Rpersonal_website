    "text": "David James Dimalanta Profile Picture\n\n\nHey! my name is David James, and I am a 1st year student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, studying Human-Centered Design. What sets me apart is my dedication to understanding and addressing user needs, a skill sharpened through my studies and hands-on project experiences. I bring a unique blend of creative design thinking and technical proficiency to the table.\n\nI began my coding journey at the start of 2023 as a New Years resolution to learn a new skill. Today, I am fortunate to be able to work with a student-led non-profit, and at a home health & hospice solutions provider. Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid reader and enjoy exploring the outdoors, which helps me stay creative and inspired.\n\nHere are some technologies I work with:\n\nJavascript (ES6+)\nReact\nNext.js\nTailwindCSS\nNode.js\nMongoDB\nWordpress, Wix, Squarespace"
